# use these gene and GO categories to find genes and GO categories that are enriched in the CNVs but then look below
###########################I think a it would be more telling to identify the overlaps between CNV calls within and between families
###########################quantify the degree of overlap within vs among families 
###########################then classify the genes that show up across families


#maybe use annotatr instead
