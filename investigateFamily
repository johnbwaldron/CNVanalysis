## samples below are twins - worth looking into the similarity of CNVs
## participant_id	Unique CID-CIND	CID	CIND	CF	CM	SEX	ADPT	TWIN
## H_NK-33GELCC30-33030	33030	33	030	87	23	1	0	1
## H_NK-33GELCC31-33031	33031	33	031	87	23	1	0	1
##!!!!!!!!!!!!!! these twins are not included in the WES sequences that were used for CNV analysis
